# Overview

This project demonstrates a framework for gathering and combining the Fama-French 5 factors (plus risk-free rate) and Momentum data into a cohesive dataset, then using weighted regression to estimate how assets load onto these factors. The model provides quantitative insights into which factors are driving an assetâ€™s performance.

Rmd file and pdf output are both attached above.
